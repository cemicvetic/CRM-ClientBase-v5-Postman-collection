# CRM-ClientBase-v5-Postman-collection

This collection includes some of the most likely API requests for the CRM project <a rel="CRM" href="https://clientbase.us/v5">CRM project "ClientBase v5"</a>. You'll also find environment variables, most of which get filled automatically during the request process.

Also, most requests include scripts and tests. I wrote them in Chai Assertion Library BDD syntax (expect) so I could develop automated tests based on them more easily. Now you just have to tweak the tests so they match the HTTP client you plan to use. Here's my collection of automated API tests <a rel href="https://github.com/cemicvetic/Testing-API-Automation-for-CRM-ClientBase-v5">here</a>.
